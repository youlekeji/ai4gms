The neonatal neurological examination was performed at term age in 157 low-risk preterm infants born between 25 and 34 weeks’ gestation who had cranial ultrasound scans that were normal or showed minor abnormalities. The distribution of scores was obtained and is shown in this article. These results are explained in the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological examination video and in the supporting scoring information. The distribution of scores is included in one of the HNNE proformas.

A group of healthy full-term infants was examined with the HNNE in the first 48 hours after birth and then again between 3 and 10 weeks of age. The paper describes how scores changed with time, and the definite shift in their distribution observed around 6 weeks of age.

This article describes the range and frequency distribution of neonatal neurological scores in a cohort of 375 low risk late-preterm infants (34-36 weeks gestation) assessed at 39-41 weeks postmenstrual age. These results can be used as reference data when examining late-preterm infants at term age.

This article presents a short version of the HNNE that can be used as a screening tool in low-risk preterm infants at term equivalent age. The proforma of this short version is available for downloading in the Recording and scoring Proformas section.

This article describes the range and frequency distribution of neonatal neurological scores in a cohort of 118 low-risk preterm infants (34-36 weeks) who were assessed between 48 and 72 hours after birth. These results can be used as reference data when examining late-preterm infants in the first 72 postnatal hours.

This study examined a cohort of low-risk term newborn Ugandan infants with the HNNE and compared the raw and optimality scores to published data from UK infants. The analysis showed that Ugandan infants had significantly stronger palmar grasp, better auditory and visual orientation, less irritability and less need for consoling but poorer tone, poorer quality of spontaneous movements and more abnormal signs than UK infants. Significantly fewer Ugandan infantshad optimal scores based on the UK data. This study

This study provides normative data (means, standard deviations and 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th and 95th centiles)  for the HNNE, the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioural Scale (NNNS) and Prechtl’s General Movements Assessment, which were administered within the first weeks after birth in a sample of 80 moderate preterm infants (32-33+6 weeks), 129 late preterm infants (34-36+6 weeks)  and 201 healthy full term infants.

This study assessed the interrater reliability of the Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE) and the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), when used both preterm and at term age in a group of 35 preterm infants and 11 term infants. The analyses showed that interrater reliability for the HNNE was excellent (ICC > 0.74) for optimality scores, and good (ICC 0.60–0.74) to excellent for subtotal scores, except for ‘Tone Patterns’ (ICC 0.54).

A cohort of 124 low risk term born newborns was examined with the HNNE within 3 h from birth or between 3 and 6 h. Each infant was re-assessed at 48 hours, and the range and frequency distribution of neonatal neurological scores at each time point were recorded and compared. The results showed that for 23/34 of the neurological items, the range and median scores were similar across the 3 time points. In the remaining 11 items the three groups had a similar range of scores but the median scores were different with different rates of changes. In 6 of the 11 the median scores at 3-6h were similar to those observed at 48h but they appeared to be ‘less mature’ at 0-3h. Only in one item the median scores were consistently different at the 3 time points. This study provides information on the very early neurological assessment of term newborn infants and shows that a complete neurological examination can already be reliably performed soon after birth.

A large cohort of preterm infants underwent early and term-equivalent-age MRI as well as several neurological clinical assessments: General Movements Assessment, Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (HNNE), NICU Neonatal Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), the Premie-Neuro, the Test of Infant Motor Performance (TIMP) and a visual assessment. The analysis showed that brain structures on early and term MRI were associated with concurrent motor, neurological and neurobehavioral function.

QA
量表HNNE HINE的区别和联系



大意是足月2个月以后要用HINE 之前用HNNE 两个月的这段时间模棱两可 两个都可以测

The HNNE can be used up to 2-3 months post-term age for recording neurological findings.

There are normative data for the HINE from 3 months but it can be used for recording findings from 2 months.   Between 3 and 7 months not all reflexes are fully developed and, in addition, control of posture matures, so it is important to take age into account when assessing the scoring and prediction of outcome.
